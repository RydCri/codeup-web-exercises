//Create a file named break_and_continue.js in the js directory.
//Prompt the user for an odd number between 1 and 50. Use a loop and a break statement to continue prompting the user if they enter invalid input.
//Use a loop and the continue statement to output all the odd numbers between 1 and 50, except for the number the user entered.
//Your output should look like this:

//var userPrompt = prompt(`Enter odd number greater than 1 and less than 50.`)
